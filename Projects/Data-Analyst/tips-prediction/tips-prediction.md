# Tips Prediction

## Abstract
This study uses machine learning to predict tips in the service industry. It analyzes various factors such as bill amount, party size, and customer characteristics to uncover patterns and correlations that influence tipping behavior. A linear regression model is developed to quantify the impact of each factor on tip amounts, providing service providers with valuable insights. By understanding these factors, service providers can optimize their strategies to improve customer satisfaction and increase their earnings. The study demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting tips and its potential implications for policy decisions and industry practices related to tipping. Overall, this research equips service providers with the tools to navigate tipping behavior, enhance their service delivery, and thrive in the competitive service industry.

## Introduction
This study explores using machine learning to predict tips in the service industry. It analyzes various factors influencing tipping behavior, like customer characteristics and service quality. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict tips, offering insights for service providers to improve their strategies and earnings.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about tips given at a restaurant, including the total bill, party size, day of the week, time of the day, and the payer's gender and smoking habits. The data is first explored using visualisation
-*Relationship between Total Bill and Tip:* A scatter plot is used to visualise the relationship between tips and the total bill, revealing a positive correlation. The size of the points represents the party size and the colour represents the day of the week, offering additional insights. The graph suggests that there is a positive correlation between the total bill and the tip amount, with higher bills generally leading higher tips.
