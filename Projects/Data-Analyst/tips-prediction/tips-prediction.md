# Tips Prediction

## Abstract
This study uses machine learning to predict tips in the service industry. It analyzes various factors such as bill amount, party size, and customer characteristics to uncover patterns and correlations that influence tipping behavior. A linear regression model is developed to quantify the impact of each factor on tip amounts, providing service providers with valuable insights. By understanding these factors, service providers can optimize their strategies to improve customer satisfaction and increase their earnings. The study demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting tips and its potential implications for policy decisions and industry practices related to tipping. Overall, this research equips service providers with the tools to navigate tipping behavior, enhance their service delivery, and thrive in the competitive service industry.

## Introduction
This study explores using machine learning to predict tips in the service industry. It analyzes various factors influencing tipping behavior, like customer characteristics and service quality. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict tips, offering insights for service providers to improve their strategies and earnings.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about tips given at a restaurant, including the total bill, party size, day of the week, time of the day, and the payer's gender and smoking habits. The data is first explored using visualisation
- **Relationship between Total Bill and Tip:** A scatter plot is used to visualise the relationship between tips and the total bill, revealing a positive correlation. The size of the points represents the party size and the colour represents the day of the week, offering additional insights. The graph suggests that there is a positive correlation between the total bill and the tip amount, with higher bills generally leading higher tips.

- **Impact of Gender on Tipping**: Another scatter plot explores the relationship between the total bill and tip, but this time the colour of the points represents the gender of the bill payer. This visualisation helps to understand if there is any difference in tipping behaviour between males and females.
- **Distribution of Tips by Day of the Week**: A pie chart illustrates the proportion of total tips received on each day of the week. It reveals that Saturday is the most lucrative day for tips, followed by Sunday, suggesting that people tend to be more generous with tips on weekends.
- **Comparison of Tips by Gender**: A pie chart compares the total tips received from male and female customers, providing insights into gender-based differences in tipping behaviour.
- **Impact of Smoking on Tipping**: A pie chart shows the proportion of tips  received from smoker and non-smokers, helping to understaand if smoking habits influence tipping.
- **Distribution of Tips by Time of Day**: A pie chart compares the total tips receied during lunch and dinner. It indicates that dinner service generates significantly more tips than lunch service, possibly due to larger bills or different dining expectations.

These visualisations provide valuable insights into the factors that influnce tipping behaviour, setting the stage for building a predictive model.

## Predictive Model
The analysis focuses on building a predictive model using linear regression. The data is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables. It is then split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set to learn relationships between predictor and target variables. Its performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like MAE or RMSE. Statistical significance tests are conducted to ensure the relationships are not due to chance.

## Result and Discussion
- **Accurate Tip Estimation**: Through the implementation of a linear regression model, we can precisely estimate tip amounts based on a range of influential factors. This model provides valuable insights into the determinants of tipping behaviour, allowing us to make informed predictions about tips.
- **Significance of Factor**:
- **Total Bill Correlation**:
- **Day and Time Influence**:
- **Customised Service Approach**:

## Conclusion
This study uses machine learning to explore tipping behavior in the service industry. Data visualization helps uncover relationships between tips and various factors. A linear regression model is built for accurate tip predictions, showcasing machine learning's potential. Future work could involve using more advanced algorithms and incorporating additional factors for even better predictions.
